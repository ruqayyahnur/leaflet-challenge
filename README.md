# Overview
The United States Geological Survey is responsible  for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. 
In this challenge, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

# Create the Earthquake Visualization
1. Get your dataset. To do so, you will use the USGS GeoJSON Feed. Ypu can choose any dataset provided to visualize. link: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
2. When you click a dataset, you will be given a JSON representation of that data. Use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization.
3. Import and Visualize the data
     - Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
     - Your *data markers* should *reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size* and the *depth of the earthquake by color*. Earthquakes with *higher magnitudes should appear larger*, and earthquakes with *greater depth should appear darker in color*.
     - *Include popups* that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
